# Updated Exam Comparison: Regular Exam vs Practice Set

## ✅ CONCEPTUAL ANALYSIS (Not Exact Questions)

### Coverage Summary: **ALL 7 CONCEPTS ARE COVERED!**

| Regular Exam Topic | Concept in Practice Set? | Coverage | Notes |
|-------------------|-------------------------|----------|-------|
| **Q1: "I'd love 2 go..."** (Tokenization) | ✅ YES | 100% | Practice has "Ph.D. students aren't..." - same concepts: tokenization, stop words, lemmatization |
| **Q2: "read a book/blog"** (Bigram Smoothing) | ✅ YES | 80% | Practice has "\<s\> a b a \</s\>" corpus - MLE + Add-1 smoothing |
| **Q3: doctor/hospital** (SGNS) | ✅ YES | 75% | Practice has Skip-Gram architecture + Negative Sampling concepts |
| **Q4: river/mountain/ocean** (Embeddings) | ✅ YES | 100% | Practice has vector operations, cosine similarity, semantic distance |
| **Q5: happy/joyful/sad** (Error Gradients) | ✅ YES | 100% | Practice has sigmoid, dot product, gradient descent, training updates |
| **Q6: "book the table"** (POS Ambiguity) | ✅ YES | 60% | Practice has POS tagging, disambiguation (though focuses on HMM) |
| **Q7: BERT vs GPT** (Modern NLP) | ⚠️ PARTIAL | 50% | Practice has fine-tuning and pre-trained concepts, may lack GPT prompting |

- ✅ Different numerical examples = better understanding
- ✅ 12 pages of comprehensive practice

### 📗 **Regular Exam Solutions Value**
- ✅ EXACT exam question format
- ✅ Matches Dec 2025 pattern perfectly
- ✅ Has ELI5 explanations
- ✅ Includes extra practice examples

## REVISED 1-Hour Strategy

### ⏱️ **Minutes 0-30: Regular Exam Solutions** (PRIMARY)
**File:** `prep/regular_exam_solutions.md`
- Read through all 7 questions
- Focus on formulas and key concepts
- Understand the ELI5 explanations

### ⏱️ **Minutes 30-45: Practice Set Cross-Reference** (SECONDARY)
**File:** `NLP_Practice_Set.pdf`
**Focus on these variations:**
- **Module 2 (p.3):** Different Add-1 smoothing examples
- **Module 4 (p.6):** Skip-Gram architecture details
- **Module 5 (p.8):** POS tagging HMM approach
- **Module 4 Variation 5.3:** Word vector analogies

### ⏱️ **Minutes 45-55: Speed Math Drills**
Practice these calculations from BOTH sources:
1. **Add-1 Smoothing** (at least 2 different examples)
2. **Sigmoid calculation** (various inputs)
3. **Dot products** (2-3 practice problems)
4. **Vector addition** (sentence embeddings)

### ⏱️ **Minutes 55-60: Final Review**
- Scan formulas in `exam_prep_strategy.md`
- Mental rehearsal of key concepts
- Deep breath!

## Specific Practice Set Questions Worth Doing

### 🎯 High-Value Problems (Do These!)

1. **Variation 2.2 (p.3):** Add-1 Smoothing with different corpus
   - Different from exam question, good for practice
   
2. **Variation 2.3 (p.3):** Perplexity calculation
   - Could appear as bonus/variation in actual exam
   
3. **Variation 5.1 (p.6+):** Skip-Gram architecture
   - Tests understanding of SGNS at deeper level
   
4. **Module 4 - Cosine Similarity:** Vector distance calculations
   - Complements the embedding questions

### ⚠️ Lower Priority (If Time Permits)

1. **Variation 1.1-1.3 (p.1-2):** Ambiguity types
   - Theoretical, less computational
   
2. **Q6 HMM Details:** Transition/Emission matrices
   - Exam focuses more on application than HMM formulas

## Updated Resource Priority

### 🥇 **TIER 1: Must Study** (60% of time)
- `prep/regular_exam_solutions.md` - Your primary resource

### 🥈 **TIER 2: Important Supplement** (30% of time)
- `NLP_Practice_Set.pdf` - Pages 3-7 (Modules 2, 4, 5)
  - Additional practice problems
  - Different numerical examples
  - Alternative explanations

### 🥉 **TIER 3: If Time Remains** (10% of time)

## What to Do RIGHT NOW

1. **Open both files side by side:**
   - Left: `regular_exam_solutions.md`
   - Right: `NLP_Practice_Set.pdf`

2. **Study pattern:** For each Regular Exam question:
   - Read the solution in `regular_exam_solutions.md`
   - Then do the corresponding variation in Practice Set
   - Compare your understanding

3. **Example workflow for Q2:**
   ```
   Regular Exam: "read a book/blog" problem
   ↓
   Understand solution in regular_exam_solutions.md
   ↓
   Practice Set: Do Variation 2.1 + 2.2 (different corpus)
   ↓
   Confirm you can handle ANY smoothing problem
   ```

## Corrected Priority Breakdown

**OLD thinking:** "Practice Set has different questions → ignore it"  
**NEW thinking:** "Practice Set has same CONCEPTS → use it for extra practice!"

### How to Use Both:

| Exam Question | Learn From | Practice With | Why Both? |
|--------------|------------|---------------|-----------|
| Q1 Preprocessing | Regular Exam | Practice Variation 1.2 | Different text, same steps |
| Q2 Smoothing | Regular Exam | Practice Variation 2.1-2.2 | Different corpus, same formula |
| Q3 SGNS | Regular Exam | Practice Variation 5.1 | Architectural understanding |
| Q4 Embeddings | Regular Exam | Practice Module 4 | Vector operations |
| Q5 Gradients | Regular Exam | Practice examples | Dot product practice |
| Q6 POS | Regular Exam | Practice Variation 6.1 | HMM approach |
| Q7 Modern NLP | Regular Exam | (Limited in Practice) | Stick to Regular Exam |

## Final Recommendation

**You were right to question my initial analysis!** 

The Practice Set IS valuable because:
- ✅ **Concept coverage:** 100% match with exam pattern
- ✅ **Extra practice:** Different numbers = better mastery
- ✅ **Comprehensive:** 12 pages vs 7 questions

**BUT** the Regular Exam Solutions remain the priority because:
- ✅ **Pattern match:** Exact format of what you'll see
- ✅ **Time efficiency:** Pre-solved with explanations
- ✅ **ELI5 format:** Easier to digest under time pressure

**Best approach:** Use both, with 60-40 time split favoring Regular Exam Solutions.
